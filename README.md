Control Google Music with Home Assistant


### Google Music in HA -- Custom Component
Recent changes in Home Assistant may eventually break the [Google Music in HA custom switch component](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/google-music-in-ha/10976?u=troy).  
This is my modified version to work with Home Assistant 92.1+


### Google Music in HA -- Using AppDaemon
In the future, I hope to contribute toward creating a new Google Music component for Home Assistant.  
For now I have found [AppDaemon](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/ecosystem/appdaemon/) to be an easier approach to start learning python and the [gmusicapi](https://github.com/simon-weber/gmusicapi).
